How to run code:
•	I have attached two iPython notebooks, you can directly open it using VScode or Jupyter Notebook and run it
    File names:
    1. MountainCar-Q Learning-Modified Reward.ipynb and
    2. MountainCar-Q Learning.ipynb

•	I have used PyTorch and Tensorboard with TensorboardX for visualization. Please make these installations

•	Please note, I’m using PyTorch 0.40 so you may run into some errors if you’re using an older version.
